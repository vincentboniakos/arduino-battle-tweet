# Arduino Battle Tweet Machine
==============================

Here is a simple project to measure the popularity of two keywords on Twitter.

## The basic part:

The web based interface allows to start a battle by entering two keywords ( simple word / expression or hashtags ).

## The fun part

We use the Twitter stream API to measure the popularity of each keywords.

As the score is updated in realtime, it controls the intensity of two LEDs, one for each competitors.

An arrow is controlled by a servo-motor and points toward the actual winner.

All in all it looks like this :
